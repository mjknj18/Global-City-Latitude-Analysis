# Global-City-Latitude-Analysis

The goal of this project was to develop a website to present how maximum temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloudiness for over 500 randomly selected global cities are related to city latitude. Since the project data was available from another GitHub repository, the necessary visualizations and data were imported directory from that location. HTML with Bootstrap CSS was used to generate, format, and link the individual webpages to from the complete website.
