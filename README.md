# Global-City-Latitude-Analysis

The goal of this project was to develop a website to present results from the Global Weather Data Analysis project. Since the completed project files were available in a GitHub repository, the necessary visualizations and data were imported directory from that location. HTML with Bootstrap CSS was used to generate, format, and link the individual webpages to form the completed website.

## Questions

1. Develop a web page presenting a summary of the project and four associated visualizations.
2. Develop four web pages presenting each of the individual visualizations, along with an associated analysis.
3. Develop a web page presenting a comparison of the four visualizations.
4. Develop a web page presenting the raw data used to create the four visualizations.
